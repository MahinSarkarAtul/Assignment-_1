        <p>
          Humans have always been entrepreneurs at their core. In early history, we were self-reliant, hunting and gathering to survive. Over time, as society evolved, we were reduced to 'labor,' forgetting our true potential. The key to ending poverty lies in empowering individuals, not limiting them. True fulfillment comes not from wealth, but from contributing to the world and making a meaningful impact.
